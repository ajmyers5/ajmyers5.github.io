                Hello!  My name is Andrew Myers and I currently work and live in Kansas City, Missouri.  
            Having lived abroad and traveling across the states, my wife and I called Denver, Colorado home for a handful of years.  While there, I began my career as an elementary school teacher.  Upon the arrival of our second child, we scooted 600 miles east and landed in KC.  Needing a change of pace, I started a small letterpress print and design shop, and started down the path of web development to further facilitate our small shop.  Cheers to web development and cheers to print!</p>
